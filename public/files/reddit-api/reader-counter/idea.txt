Procedurally adding divs to the HTML.

Divs to be treated as objects.

Contents of the objects:
    - name of the subreddit [DONE]
    - an array for previously recorded values [not yet]
    - a constructor
        - places down HTML objects
            - a table for the constantly refreshing data
            - a paragraph for the subreddit name
            - a paragraph for the most recent number
            - a table for various predictions

    - a function that updates [DONE]
        - writes the most recent number to the corresponding paragraph [DONE]
        - pushes that number to the array
    - a predictor function
        - updates the content of the table
            - predicts to 7, 30 and 365 days
                - based on the entire array content
                - based on the last 10-20-50-100 recordings



Future features:

cross comparison (needs public object data access)
save to database, or at least, to txt
highlight in case of huge changes
order subreddits by subscriber amount
add "last update clock" for every div alone
display most recent post
add items from /r/trendingreditts automatically
table expanding: by date vs by reader treshold
UPDATE SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY BUGGY, MAKE IT TO ONE QUERY PER CYCLE PLES
